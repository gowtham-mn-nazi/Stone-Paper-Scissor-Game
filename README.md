This is a simple yet interactive Stone Paper Scissors (Rock Paper Scissors) game built using Python (Flask) for the backend and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend. The game allows users to play against a computer with randomized choices and keeps track of the number of wins, losses, and draws in real time. The UI is designed to be clean, responsive, and fully centered in a bordered game container for a smooth user experience. This project demonstrates how web technologies can be combined with Python to build dynamic, browser-based applications and is ideal for beginners exploring Flask and frontend integration.
